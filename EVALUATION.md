# Evaluation

This table explains how certain parts of the assignment will be evaluated and graded.
You can use this to make sure your implementation touches the right evaluation points.

| Evaluation Point           | Description                                                                                                                                   | Points |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Structured commits         | The commit history should be clear and concise, while informing readers about the changes                                                     |        |
| Modelling UML              | The candidate shows knowledge about class relations and modeling in UML                                                                       |        |
| Modelling Sequence Diagram | The candidate shows knowledge about making sequence diagrams explaining how the application behaves in all possible scenarios                 |        |
| Structuring code (DDD)     | The candidate has correctly identified the layers of the application, and separated them into folders that make sense according to the domain |        |
| Testing                    | The candidate has applied Test-Driven Development and wrote tests that cover the requirements for the Notification entity                     |        |
| Integration                | The candidate has implemented the application layer and integrated it with the domain layer                                                   |        |
| Understanding              | The candidate can summarize the application and explain how it works, and can explain the choices made in the implementation                  |        |
